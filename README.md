# GorillaPhysicsPlus
A Physical System Similar to LemmingVR's Gorilla Locomotion. Instead of using raycasting this system uses Rigidbodies and Configurable Joints

Fixed to work on unity 6 and possibly older with new features such as grabbing static objects, and more on the way

coming soon to the Github near you!
